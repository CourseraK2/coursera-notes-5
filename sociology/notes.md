# Sociology

MOOC on Open2Study.

## Module 1: The Sociological Imagination

### Topic 1: The Sociological Imagination

“It made much sense to me to understand what was happening with individuals, why we behave the way that we did, why some people in their lives seem to have so many misfortunes and others much more fortunate.  It made so much sense to me to look outside of psychological or individualistic explanations and understand instead how a society can impact on us, how it can impact on the way that we think and the things that we do.”

* Sociologists are interested in sociological change

* Individualistic explanations don’t give us as much explanation as sociological explanation.

* Contemporary Western societies really value individualistic explanations for human behavior

* The Sociological Imagination by C Wright Mills:
  - “Neither the life of an individual not the history of a society can be understoon without understanding both.”
  - “People with advantages are loath to believe that they just happen to be people with advantages.”

* Unemployment: No credible individualistic explanation for a structural problem like that.

* Structure vs Agency debate

### Topic 2: Social Structure vs Social Agency

* Revolutionary Road by Richard Yates
  - Structure vs Agency
  - “Look at us. We‘re just like everyone else. We‘ve bought into the same, ridiculous delusion”
  - Norms of our society can dictate our behaviors

* Pregnancy and Childbirth
  - Might look purely biological
  - From a Sociological perspective, there are patterns
  - For e.g. in Australia, spike in caeseran births recently. Is it individual, or sociological? Is there agency involved?

### Topic 3: Why Sociologists Use Theory

* Anthony Giddens
  - reference to a painting
  - very intricate
  - painting can be described, but can it be ‘understood’?
  - title: “Netherlandish Proverbs”
  - The title makes things clear suddenly

* Theory understands things at a much a deeper level

* Beginnings of sociology
  - Three men (next topic)
  - They were alive during a time period of drastic social changes: industrial revolution
  - Sociology was developed as a social science to understand and control social change

* Auguste Comte
  - Lived through the French Revolution
  - “Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal”
  - His motto is still blazed across the Brazilan flag: “Ordem e Progresso”
  - the idea that we can take the laws of the natural world and apply them to the social world has been heavily critiqued.
  - However Comte is credited with coming up with the term “Sociology”


### Topic 4: Founding Fathers of Sociology

* Emile Durkheim
  - Founding Father of “Functionalism”
  - Durkheim was really concerned about these changes from a type a society that was held together by individuals who had very similar types of values, who did very similar types of things to the change over to a society that was more based on diversity.
  - Queston of “Social Order” (analogy of a clock and its structure)

* Marx
  - Essentially an economist
  - Sociologists like to claim him because he brought the economic back to the social
  - Base and Superstructure model is a useful way of understanding the way society operates (More in module 2)
  - Base: Economy (It drives what is in the rest of society)
  - Superstructure: Everything else - education, religion, family structures
  - Tribalism -> Feudalism -> Capitalism -> Socialism (a possible evolution)

* Weber
  - Not a structalist, but more of an interactionist
  - Influenced by Marx, but highly critical of him
  - He believed in the interaction between structure and individual much more than Marx did
  - Ideas of individuals could really change society much more than what Marx or Durkheim believed
  - “Verstehen” - grasp by insight
  - try and put ourselves into the position of the individuals that we're studying and to understand what's happening in their social world by doing this.

### Topic 5: Why is Culture Important

* Whale Rider Trailer
  - Culture can relate somewhat to the idea of Structure
  - You can really see quite clearly distinct interactions within this group, patterns of interaction that are impacting on the way that people think and people act.  Its impacting on their roles and how they enact those roles.
  - You can also see how culture has changed has somewhat shifted and changed and how it is being expressed differently across the generations

* Sociologists don‘t think and study culture as something that is static. Culture is fluid.

* For e.g. Beauty. How do we guage beauty? Beauty is different across time and space

* Two aspects to culture: material and non-material
  - Material: Dress, Architecture, Food
  - Non Material Culture: Language, Gestures, Values

* Food
  - As individuals, food is an important way of representing different things - rituals, status, social relationships

* Ethnocentrism
  - A problem when we live in diverse societier

### Topic 6: Values, Norms and Sanctions

* Values
  - What you culture sees as valuable

* Norms
  - Ideas that are going to regulate our behavior
  - Deviancy: Going against the norms and values of your society

* Sanctions
  - Positive and Negative sanctions
  - A look, a word or a graver form of punishments

* How Sanctions Work
  - Types of Deviancy: Folkways and Mores
  - Folkways are simply this idea of, we have an expectation in our society to see things happen in a certain way. That‘s the influence of structure.
  - Mores relate to criminal law

* In one society, you don‘t necessarily have a homogenized culture. There may be a dominant culture from which values and norms comes from

* Subcultures: Punks, Hippies etc
  - Align themselves with the dominant culture
  - May reject some of the values and norms associated with it

* Countercultures: Survivalists
  - Go against the dominant culture

### Topic 7: Values – Case Study of Australia

* Australia a multicultural society
* There is a dominant culture
* One of the central values: Egalitarianism
  - Seen as a Workingman's paradise in the beginning
  - There is a distaste for pretension and authority
  - Bob Hawke (everyone loved him), Paul Keating (people disliked him)
  - Tall Poppy Syndrome (studies between Australian and American students)
* Another central value: Mateship
  - Expressed in male culture
  - Loyalty, Fairness, trying to protect the underdog
  - Strong under unions
  - Originated in the ANZAC

### Topic 8: Socialisation Into the Self

* The idea of how the Self gets developed
  - Two early social theories
  - Self is closely interconnected with the social
  - Self develops through interaction with others
  - Illustrated well by the film Monster (Charlize Theron who plays the murderer, and the development of her identity)

* Social Psychologist Cooley
  - Looking Glass Self
  - The idea that as we develop and interact, we start to interpret others and how they react to us. We evaluate the other person’s cues and we change ourselves accordingly.

* George Herbert Mead
  - Developing off Cooley, but much more
  - Symbolic Interactionism
  - When were are babies, we ‘Imitate’
  - As we get older, we enter into ‘Play’. We can take on one other role and internalise that role.
  - Next stage is the ‘Game’. Instead of just internalising the role of one other, you are internalising the role of many others.

### Topic 9: Socialisation Into Gender and Emotions

* Socialisation
  - How we learn our culture
  - We primarily are socialised to our society through agents of socialisation

* 5 Agents of Socialisation
  - Family. What does it mean to be a woman and man. Religion.
  - Education. It socialises us to our _particular_ society
  - Peers
  - Work
  - Media. Extremely important in presenting to us images and values of society. For e.g. the idea of gender. What it means to be a woman, how do we present ourselves

* Emotions
  - Basic emotions common across all societies
  - How we express our emotions are very much determined by the societies around us.
